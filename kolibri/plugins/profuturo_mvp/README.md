# ProFuturo MVP Kolibri Plugin

This Kolibri plugin is temporarily located inside the Kolibri repo, but must be moved into a new repo before merging this branch back into the mainline.

The plugin is responsible for:

* setting theme custom Profuturo theme
* setting Profuturo-specific sandbox settings for the SCORM/HTML5 apps
* setting options to enable experimental user import functionality
