What is Kolibri?
----------------

Kolibri is an adaptable measured learning environment. A user can install Kolibri and serve the app on a local network,
without an internet connection. Kolibri installations can be linked to one another, so that user data and content can
be shared. Users can create content for Kolibri and share it when there is network access to another Kolibri
installation or the internet.

At its core, Kolibri is about serving educational content. A typical user (called a Learner) will log in to Kolibri
to consume educational content (videos, documents, other multimedia) and test their understanding of the content by
completing exercises and quizzes, with immediate feedback. A user’s activity will be tracked to offer individualized
insight (like “next lesson” recommendations), and to allow user data to be synced across different installations --
thus a Kolibri learner can use his or her credentials on any linked Kolibri installation, for instance on different
devices at a school.

The project is just starting, but we want the entire development process, from conception to realization, to be carried
out in the open. More will be added to this section in the very near future!
