Exercises
~~~~~~~~~

Kolibri **Exercises** can require you to do different things: fill in a missing number, write a formula, choose one of the available options, etc. Each correct answer gets you a checkmark, and majority of exercises require 5 correct answers in a row to be completed. Some exercises can offer one or more hints, to help you solving the problem. 

Independent of the required action (writing an answer yourself or choosing one of the options), these are the steps to follow.

#. Once you have achieved 5 correct answers in a row, click the **Next item** button, to continue learning with the rest of the material in that topic.
#. If you are unable to solve some questions, try reviewing the videos in the **Recommended** section below the exercise, or seek help from your peers or teacher/coach.
