Assign Additional Permissions
-----------------------------

By default, only **Super users** can view the **Device** dashboard, **Import/Export** content channels in Kolibri and modify permissions for other users. However, according to the needs of your deployment, **Super users** can grant these permissions to other users too. Read more about how to :ref:`permissions`.
